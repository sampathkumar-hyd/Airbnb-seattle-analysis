### Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.x

### Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Airbnb Seattle data from Kaggle to better understand:

  1. What are the top contributing features for pricing?
  2. How are Airbnb prices distributed across top 3 features?
  3. What are the most expensive zipcodes in Seattle?

The full set of files related to this course are owned by Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data)

### File Descriptions
The project consists of 3 CSV files downloaded from Kaggle. These are the data files. They are named as
  1. calendar.csv
  2. listings.csv
  3. reviews.zip
The reviews.csv is too big to be uploaded into github and hence has been compressed into reviews.zip file and uploaded. You should unzip the file into reviews.csv before executing the notebook.

The project also consists of a notebook to show case the actual analysis.

### Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.

### Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgements
The data for this analysis was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
