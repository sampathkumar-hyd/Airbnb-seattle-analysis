### Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.x

### Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Airbnb Seattle data from Kaggle to better understand:

  1. What are the top contributing features for pricing?
  2. How are Airbnb prices distributed across top 3 features?
  3. What are the most expensive zipcodes in Seattle?
